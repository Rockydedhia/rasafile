The clock will restart on the date on which the applicant pays the further fees. The PIO will have to provide the information within 25 days from the date of payment of such further fees. If the applicant chooses to seek a review of the additional fee from the appellate authority or the SIC/CIC the period taken for giving a decision on this matter (if it is decided that no further payment is needed) or for actual payment of further fees (if it is decided that further fees would need to be paid), will not be included in the 30 day limit."

  utter_expansion:
  - text: "Managed expansion/ regression represents an increase/decrease in the area of a land cover type due to human activity. Generally, the managed expansion/regression of one land cover type will also lead to the recording of a matching entry for managed regression/expansion of another land cover type. A matching entry is not recorded if there is a managed expansion in the total area of land within scope of the account (e.g., in the case of land reclamation)."

  utter_Nautral_Expansion:
  - text: "Natural expansion/ regression is an increase/decrease in area resulting from natural processes including seeding, sprouting, suckering, layering or erosion by sea. In the case of sparse natural vegetation and terrestrial barren land, the natural loss of vegetation from other vegetation types would lead to increases in these areas. Changes in the extent of permanent snow, glaciers and inland water bodies can also be due to natural variation in rainfall."

  utter_Reappraisals:
  - text: "Reappraisals can be upward or downward and can reflect changes due to the use of updated information that permits a reassessment of the size of the area of different land covers, for example, from new satellite imagery or interpretation of satellite imagery. The use of updated information may require the revision of previous estimates to ensure a continuity of time series."
